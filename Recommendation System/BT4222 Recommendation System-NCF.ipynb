It is a general framework that can be used to express and generalize matrix factorization under its framework.\n","\n","### How does it work?\n","\n","NCF works by first representing users and items as vectors in a latent space. These vectors are then used to calculate a score for each user-item pair. The score is then used to predict whether the user will interact with the item.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1XeVQzx0PUoYguN2v3GG2y5hsiFrAFHm8\"></img>\n","\n","### Why is it useful?\n","\n","NCF is useful because it can learn non-linear relationships between users and items. This makes it a more powerful model than traditional matrix factorization methods.\n","\n","Since we are using neural networks to find relation between users and items, we can easily scale the solution to large datasets. Thus making this method better than Item based collaborative filtering\n","\n","There are more complex architectures of NCF, for more information please visit the following link\n","\n","*   https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-collaborative-filtering-96cef1009401\n","\n","\n","<font size=1> Content of the notebook is taken from the following repository: https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/tree/main/recommenders </font>"],"metadata":{"id":"xDNS_hi9itoI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Setting up the environment (~4mins)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"xSJsEA9ZNduh"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"DczE5pqyNSe9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1691498123948,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":165293,"user":{"displayName":"Harsh","userId":"03191827286572319654"}},"outputId":"9a5646f0-8dce-487d-81da-a0bf5f86ee59"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["--2023-08-08 12:32:38--  https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py39_23.5.2-0-Linux-x86_64.sh\n","Resolving repo.anaconda.com (repo.anaconda.com)... 104.16.130.3, 104.16.131.3, 2606:4700::6810:8303, ...\n","Connecting to repo.anaconda.com (repo.anaconda.com)|104.16.130.3|:443... connected.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK\n","Length: 93409434 (89M) [application/x-sh]\n","Saving to: ‘Miniconda3-py39_23.5.2-0-Linux-x86_64.sh’\n","\n","Miniconda3-py39_23. 100%[===================>]  89.08M   166MB/s    in 0.5s    \n","\n","2023-08-08 12:32:39 (166 MB/s) - ‘Miniconda3-py39_23.5.2-0-Linux-x86_64.sh’ saved [93409434/93409434]\n","\n","PREFIX=/usr/local\n","Unpacking payload ...\n","                                                                              \n","Installing base environment...\n","\n","\n","Downloading and Extracting Packages\n","\n","\n","Downloading and Extracting Packages\n","\n","Preparing transaction: - \b\b\\ \b\b| \b\b/ \b\b- \b\b\\ \b\b| \b\b/ \b\b- \b\b\\ \b\b| \b\b/ \b\b- \b\b\\ \b\b| \b\b/ \b\b- \b\b\\ \b\bdone\n","Executing transaction: / \b\b- \b\b\\ \b\b| \b\b/ \b\b- \b\b\\ \b\b| \b\b/ \b\b- \b\b\\ \b\b| \b\b/ \b\b- \b\b\\ \b\b| \b\b/ \b\b- \b\b\\ \b\b| \b\b/ \b\b- \b\b\\ \b\b| \b\b/ \b\b- \b\b\\ \b\b| \b\b/ \b\b- \b\b\\ \b\b| \b\b/ \b\b- \b\b\\ \b\b| \b\b/ \b\b- \b\b\\ \b\b| \b\b/ \b\b- \b\b\\ \b\b| \b\b/ \b\b- \b\b\\ \b\b| \b\b/ \b\b- \b\b\\ \b\b| \b\b/ \b\bdone\n","installation finished.\n","WARNING:\n","    You currently have a PYTHONPATH environment variable set.
